# Notion Page Widget

I often find that I would like to have an image of a page in Notion link to that particular page. Sort of like it is possible with pages in a gallery view, but without all the view UI around it - and for individual pages as needed.

The output of this <i>website</i> is meant to be embedded into a page in Notion and displays another page similar to the pages in the gallery view. It borrows the UI from the Notion home page widgets on Android (and maybe iOS too) and it also links to the page when clicked.
